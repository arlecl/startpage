This is a small project over where the main effort goes to Cel51.

This startpage is mainly to keep a clean overview instead of a bookmark bar while uncluding some nice gadgets such as weather, clock, search functionality, news,...

# Soundcloud 

It's really simple to use it. There's a help inside the terminal.

[Get your custom app identification](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/)

This version requires you to login each time you want to use Soundcloud, it's because there's no need of a PHP server.

# How to use it ?

## The left pannel

The left pannel is pretty much self explained, there's no ambiguous way to use it because there's no way to actually use it.

## The mid pannel

### The search bar

Simply add "!<the letter>" to search something, if you don't put "!" you will search on the first searchengine.

### The bookmarks 

Just click on the link or the shortcut

## The right pannel

### Terminal

There's many command on the terminal, but you will use the "f <shortcut>" to open the bookmark wanted. Everything else is in the help of each fonction.

### RSS board

Simply click on the link to open the article

# Next version
I don't have any more ideas or maybe 1 or 2 like Riot Games api for games but I will see if I have the time to do it. So you can send me your recommendations inside the issues part of the project.
